### Cleaning Process
The Data was opened in the Power Query after loading it into Power BI .
- I modelled the data so as to ensure Dimensions and fact Table were put correctly .
- I Changed columns with incorrect datatypes to the appropriate ones .
- I made sure my region corresponded with my data to remove errors associated with the price 
column.
- I created new columns like, Day of the week, time of the day , Months etc by extracting the data 
from the date column .
- I also created a new measure " Revenue" that is the multiplication of the quantity by the price .
